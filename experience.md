## My life story (a work in progress :)\)
<div style="text-align: justify">
I have been developing web applications and mobile solutions for more than 5 years now. I majored in Computer Science during my undergrad. My numerous internships further made me competent enough to pickup new frameworks in a matter of days. After graduating in the top 5 students of my class, I joined Lochbridge - an Internet-of-Things firm. Developing native (Android) and hybrid (Android and iOS) mobile applications using cutting-edge frameworks further embellished my skill-set. From devising wireframe models to deploying applications, the experience allowed me to acquire a spectrum of system administration, front-end and back-end skills. 

My background as a software engineer allows me to play around with a plethora of technologies and build end-to-end products tapping into my multi-faceted skills. 

An early interest in machine learning motivated me to work on several personal projects through the years leveraging techniques like neural nets, sentiment analysis, recommender systems etc. As a Master's student in Computer Science I want to further augment my intuition with the theoretical background necessary for fields like applied machine learning, distributed computing and natural language processing.

## Freelance Work
### Sofware Developer at Iwynoworks, Austin
<div style="text-align: justify">
Collaborated in a 3 person team that developed an ML based book recommender system targeted at early/young readers. The platform leverages knowledge of leveled books read by children to infer their reading prowess. Additionally, the platform automatically estimates the level of unleveled books by correlatingreading patterns ofreaders inthe same cohort. The application aims at identifying books encouraging each reader to gradually progress their reading abilities and create better readers
